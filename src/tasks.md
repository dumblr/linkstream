# Tasks

- If not loaded from dat://, show <DatPopup/> component, which gives some instructions on how to interact or create your own.

  - you can check if https or dat:// by running the try/catch with DatArchive and setting some state (this.state.p2p or this.state.http or whatever), like here: https://github.com/kodedninja/orkl/blob/master/src/orkl.js#L16

- Can files always be 'published' ? Do you need to click the 'hot reload' button?

  - do we need to use webdb?
